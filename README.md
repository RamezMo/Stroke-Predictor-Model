# Stroke-Predictor-Model : Machine Learning Model for Forecasting Stroce with nearly 98% accuracy

## Introduction

In today's healthcare landscape, predictive modeling plays a crucial role in preemptively identifying health risks and guiding preventive care strategies. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict strokes using the Healthcare Dataset Stroke available on Kaggle. By analyzing factors such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and glucose levels, this model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early identification and intervention for stroke-prone individuals.
